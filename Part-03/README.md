# Conduct a Tabletop Exercise to Evaluate Network Incident Response Preparedness

## Objective:
- Evaluate network incident response preparedness through a tabletop exercise.

1. Introduction to Tabletop Exercise

In this part of our session, we will conduct a tabletop exercise to evaluate our preparedness for network incidents. A tabletop exercise is a discussion-based session where team members meet to discuss their roles during an emergency and their responses to a particular incident scenario. This helps in identifying gaps in our incident response plan and improving our overall preparedness

**What is a Tabletop Exercise?**

* A tabletop exercise is a simulation of an emergency situation in an informal, stress-free environment.
* It is designed to test the effectiveness of an organization's incident response plan.
* Participants discuss their roles and responses to a hypothetical incident, allowing them to identify strengths and weaknesses in their current procedures.

**Why is it Important?**
* Helps in understanding the roles and responsibilities of each team member during an incident.
* Identifies gaps and weaknesses in the incident response plan.
* Improves coordination and communication among team members.
* Enhances overall preparedness for real-world incidents.

2. Scenario Presentation

Let's present a hypothetical network incident scenario related to smart manufacturing. This scenario will help us evaluate our response plan and identify areas for improvement.


**Scenario: The Quick Fix**
Rambo, your network administrator, is overworked and underpaid. His bags are packed and ready for a family vacation to Disney World when he is tasked with deploying a critical patch. In order to make his flight, Rambo quickly builds an installation file for the patch and deploys it before leaving for his trip. Next, Rambo, the on-call service desk technician, begins receiving calls that nobody can log in. It turns out that no testing was done for the recently installed critical patch.

**Key Points to Consider:**

* How was the issue detected?
* What immediate actions should be taken to contain the incident?
* How will the team identify the extent of the issue and the affected systems?
* What steps will be taken to remediate the issue and recover from the incident?
* How will communication be managed internally and externally?
* What measures can be implemented to prevent similar incidents in the future?

3. Group Discussion and Response Planning

Now, let's divide into small groups. Each group will discuss the scenario and develop a response plan. Consider the key points we just discussed and outline the steps your team would take to respond to the incident.

**Roles and Responsibilities:**

- Incident Commander (IC): Leads the response effort, coordinates with all teams, and makes final decisions.
- Network Administrator (NA): Responsible for identifying and containing the issue, and implementing technical solutions.
- Security Analyst (SA): Investigates the root cause, assesses the impact, and ensures that security measures are in place.
- Communications Officer (CO): Manages internal and external communication, including updates to stakeholders and public relations.
- IT Support (ITS): Provides technical support to users affected by the incident and assists in the recovery process.

**Tasks for Each Group:**

- Identify the Incident:
* How was the issue detected?
* What indicators of compromise (IoCs) were observed?
- Contain the Incident:
* What immediate actions should be taken to prevent further damage?
* How will the affected systems be isolated?
- Eradicate the Threat:
* How will the team identify and remove the problematic patch?
* What tools and techniques will be used?
- Recover from the Incident:
* How will the systems be restored to normal operation?
* What steps will be taken to ensure the integrity of the manufacturing process?
- Communication and Coordination:
* How will communication be managed within the team and with external stakeholders?
* What information will be shared and with whom?
- Prevent Future Incidents:
* What measures can be implemented to prevent similar incidents in the future?
* How can the patch deployment process be improved?

4. Possible Solution -  Steps to Debug, Solve, and Avoid the Issue

Given the scenario where a critical patch was deployed without testing, leading to a network incident, here are the steps to debug, solve, and avoid this issue in the future:


1. Immediate Detection and Identification:
- Monitor Alerts: Ensure that monitoring systems are in place to detect login failures and other anomalies.
- Log Analysis: Check system logs to identify the time and nature of the issue. Look for patterns indicating the patch deployment as the cause.
2. Containment:
- Isolate Affected Systems: Temporarily isolate the affected systems to prevent further impact. This may involve disconnecting them from the network or disabling certain services.
- Notify Stakeholders: Inform relevant stakeholders, including IT staff, management, and affected users, about the issue and the steps being taken.
3. Eradication:
- Rollback the Patch: If possible, roll back the patch to the previous stable state. This can be done using system restore points or backup images.
- Verify System Integrity: Ensure that the rollback has restored normal functionality and that no residual issues remain.
4. Recovery:
- Test Systems: Conduct thorough testing to ensure that all systems are functioning correctly after the rollback.
- Restore Services: Gradually bring the isolated systems back online and monitor for any recurring issues.
User Support: Provide support to users who may still be experiencing issues and ensure they can log in and access necessary services.
5. Root Cause Analysis:
- Investigate the Patch: Analyze the patch to understand why it caused the issue. This may involve reviewing the patch code, configuration changes, and compatibility with existing systems.
- Document Findings: Document the root cause and the steps taken to resolve the issue. This will be useful for future reference and training.
6. Preventive Measures:
- Implement a Testing Protocol: Establish a rigorous testing protocol for all patches and updates. This should include:
    - Development Environment Testing: Test patches in a controlled development environment that mirrors the production environment.
    - User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Conduct UAT with a small group of users to identify any issues before full deployment.
    - Staged Rollout: Deploy patches in stages, starting with non-critical systems, to monitor for issues before a full rollout.
- Change Management Process: Implement a formal change management process that includes:
    - Approval Workflow: Ensure that all changes are reviewed and approved by relevant stakeholders before deployment.
    - Scheduled Maintenance Windows: Schedule patch deployments during maintenance windows to minimize impact on operations.
    - Communication Plan: Develop a communication plan to inform users about upcoming changes and potential impacts.
- Training and Awareness: Provide training to IT staff on best practices for patch management and incident response. Ensure that all team members are aware of the protocols and procedures.
7. Continuous Improvement:
- Review and Update Policies: Regularly review and update patch management and incident response policies to incorporate lessons learned from incidents.
- Conduct Regular Tabletop Exercises: Continue to conduct tabletop exercises to test and refine incident response plans. Use different scenarios to cover a wide range of potential issues.
- Monitor and Audit: Continuously monitor systems for compliance with policies and conduct regular audits to ensure adherence to best practices.

By following these steps, you can effectively debug, solve, and prevent similar issues in the future, ensuring the security and stability of your network and systems.
